# Relative-Humidity-Sensor-using-PIC18F45K22
The objective of this project was to design a device that can read and display 
relative humidity. The approach implemented in this project was to build a 
circuit containing the 555 Timer and the HCH-1000 sensor that outputs a 
square signal. Then, the microcontroller (PIC18K45F22) will first record the 
frequency of that signal and then calculate the relative humidity and display it 
on the LCD.
